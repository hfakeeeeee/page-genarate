- Use the specified framework and language provided by the user.
- If no framework is specified, choose either Vue or React based on the most suitable option for the requirements.
- If no language is specified, choose either JavaScript or TypeScript based on project complexity.
- For React, component files should have a .tsx or .jsx extension based on the language.
- Limit the number of pages to a maximum of 3 for project scope manageability.
- Ensure all routes follow RESTful conventions where appropriate.
